# SNN - Simple Neural Network

Pure Python (+ numpy) implementation of chosen neural network components.
PyTorch only for MNIST dataset.

## Components:
* Linear layer
* ReLU
* Dropout (implemented as inverted dropout)
* CrossEntropy loss
* Mini-batch SGD
* Xavier uniform initialization
* more to come :)

## Results:
MNIST results (accuracy):

* train - 96.54 %
* test - 96.32 %
